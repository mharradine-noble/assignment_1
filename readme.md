# assignment_1: Portfolio

## Overview

This is the first rendition to my personal portfolio website. It is going to be designed so showcase my skills and previous works as I build up my portfolio. The site will continue to be updated as I learn more skills and develop a better understanding for coding. 

## Components

### Header
The header has the logo name, company logo and the navigation bar with pages titled services, portfolio, about and contact.
